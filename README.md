## Flappy Bird

Flappy bird clone using C++/glfw/OpenGL.

For compiling the project, you need to have:

### -gcc ( that supports C++17 )
### -cmake( atleast 3.10 ) installed.

#### Make sure that their instalation path is set in the PATH enviroment variable.

For compiling the project simply just run the **build.bat** file and it will build automatically. for compiling in debug mode, run build_debug.bat.

For running the program, you will need **OpenGL 3.0+**. all other nessacery dynamic link files are supplied in the repository.

For running the project, simply just execute **run.bat** for normal build, and **run_debug.bat** for debugging ( debug build ).

run.bat will supply the nessacery dynamic link files for the executable, if you wish to copy the executable somewhere else or ship it, you need to also copy the dynamic link files into the executable directory itself, or if you want to use the .bat file, you need to copy them with respect to the relative path they have with the run.bat file.
